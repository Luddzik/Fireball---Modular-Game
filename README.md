# Fireball - Modular-Game

Game designed from modular components, avoid the fireballs at any cost. All assets in the game are created by myself.
The project is created in C# and using Unity. Blender was used to create the assets. 

The idea of the game was to create multiplayer game where each player will have a shield and is able to reflect the balls
that are projected on the map. It is a dark style game with fire pits being the only light source in the game. 
Game being played in third person perspective.
